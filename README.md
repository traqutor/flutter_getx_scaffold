# flutter_getx_scaffold

Let's create a comprehensive scaffold that includes state management with GetX, a robust navigation system, and internationalization with flutter_localizations.

## Getting Started

Here's a summary of what created:

Structured Application Architecture:

Feature-based organization for better code maintenance
Core modules for shared functionality
Separation of concerns (controllers, views, models)


GetX Implementation:

Reactive state management with .obs variables
Dependency injection with Get.put() and Get.lazyPut()
Navigation system with named routes


Internationalization:

Support for multiple languages (English, Polish)
Translations managed through GetX


Theme Management:

Light and dark theme support
Theme persistence using SharedPreferences


Settings System:

Theme selection
Language selection
Notifications toggle
